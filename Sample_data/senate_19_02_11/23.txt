    SENATE RESOLUTION 63--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF 
FEBRUARY 12, 2019, AS ``DARWIN DAY'' AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
                 SCIENCE IN THE BETTERMENT OF HUMANITY

  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Whitehouse) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:

                               S. Res. 63

       Whereas Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution by 
     the mechanism of natural selection, which, together with the 
     monumental amount of scientific evidence Charles Darwin 
     compiled to support the theory, provides humanity with a 
     logical and intellectually compelling explanation for the 
     diversity of life on Earth;
       Whereas the validity of the theory of evolution by natural 
     selection developed by Charles Darwin is further strongly 
     supported by the modern understanding of the science of 
     genetics;
       Whereas it has been the human curiosity and ingenuity 
     exemplified by Charles Darwin that has promoted new 
     scientific discoveries that have helped humanity solve many 
     problems and improve living conditions;
       Whereas the advancement of science must be protected from 
     those unconcerned with the adverse impacts of global warming 
     and climate change;
       Whereas the teaching of creationism in some public schools 
     compromises the scientific and academic integrity of the 
     education systems of the United States;
       Whereas Charles Darwin is a worthy symbol of scientific 
     advancement on which to focus and around which to build a 
     global celebration of science and humanity intended to 
     promote a common bond among all the people of the Earth; and
       Whereas February 12, 2019, is the anniversary of the birth 
     of Charles Darwin in 1809 and would be an appropriate date to 
     designate as ``Darwin Day'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of ``Darwin Day''; and
       (2) recognizes Charles Darwin as a worthy symbol on which 
     to celebrate the achievements of reason, science, and the 
     advancement of human knowledge.
