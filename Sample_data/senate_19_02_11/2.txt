                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our Redeemer, thank You for Your abundant mercy and grace. You 
continue to do for us more than we can ask or imagine.
  Guide the steps of our Senators. May they look to You to bring them 
to Your desired destination, as You surround them with the shield of 
Your divine favor.
  Eternal King, help us all to never forget how Your sustaining grace 
has kept us in the past. May the memories of Your loving providence in 
our history infuse us with the spirit of optimism for all of our 
tomorrows.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
