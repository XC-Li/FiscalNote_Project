                     HONORING CLAYTON JOEL TOWNSEND

<bullet> Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and 
legacy of Officer Clayton Townsend, killed in the line of duty on 
January 8, 2019, at the age of 26. Officer Townsend was born in 
Glendale, AZ, on May 30, 1992. He was a dedicated, loyal, and highly 
skilled police officer at the Salt River Police Department. Our State 
will miss him dearly.
  Officer Townsend served the Salt River Police Department for 5 years 
and was applauded by superiors on numerous occasions for excellent 
communication skills and performance on the job. He had always dreamed 
of becoming a police officer and truly embodied a genuine, caring, and 
compassionate commitment to protect and serve others.
  Officer Townsend is survived by his wife Deanna, his 10-month-old son 
Brixton, and his mother Toni. He will be dearly missed by other family 
members, friends, and hundreds of bereaved members of the Salt River 
community. In the words of his older brother Cole, Clayton ``brought a 
warmth with him wherever he went. He had a smile that everyone felt.'' 
Please join me in honoring his memory.<bullet>
